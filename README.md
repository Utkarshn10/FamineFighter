 <p align="center" width="400px"> <font size="5"> <b> We have built a platform in which people, organization,
                  restaurants, etc can come together and donate their surplus
                  food. Through this platform, we are planning to solve two
                  major issues, the world is facing right now. First being
                  reduction of food wastage and second being reducing hunger. We
                  together plan to make this world worth living and provide a
                  life that everyone deserves!<br />
                  The site contains mainly two pages Form and the Available restaurants page.</p>
